        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe outlines the steps to make traditional Valencian paella with chicken and rabbit. Firstly, saffron
            is
            toasted until fragrant, then ground and set aside. Chicken and rabbit are seasoned and browned in a paella
            pan
            before green beans, tomatoes, and garlic are added and cooked. The mixture is flavored with piment√≥n,
            saffron,
            chicken stock, and water. Rice is then added and cooked until tender, with occasional stirring. Towards the
            end,
            the heat is increased to develop a crispy bottom layer (socarrat). Finally, the paella is left to rest
            briefly
            before serving.
        </p>
        <p>In summary, the recipe involves toasting saffron, browning seasoned chicken and rabbit, cooking vegetables,
            adding rice and liquid, simmering until tender, and crisping the bottom layer. This results in a flavorful
            and
            aromatic Valencian paella ready to be enjoyed.</p>
