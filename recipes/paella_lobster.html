        <p>One of the best rice recipes we have is rice with lobster, one of my favorites without a doubt. It is very
            easy to prepare and today I am going to show you the secrets of the most delicious traditional recipe.</p>

        <p>In Spain we have hundreds of traditional rice recipes, from this easy rice with chicken, to this rice with
            vegetables, an exquisite broth like this brothy seafood rice, this different octopus and sausage paella, or
            these two paellas, paella de rabbit and paella mix.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting the live lobster. This is important. Remove and discard the head, then cut the body
                lengthwise. Remove the claws and cut the body into several pieces. If it's inconvenient for you, ask the
                fishmonger to do it for you.</li>
            <li>Sear the lobster pieces in a wide and shallow pan to release all the juices, for about 5 minutes on each
                side. Once done, remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, sauté the garlic cloves, onion, and red bell pepper for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the time has passed, add the peeled and grated tomato (or you can use tomato sauce), the red
                pepper or ñora paste, and the saffron. Sauté for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the Bomba rice and stir well to coat it with the flavors of the sofrito.</li>
            <li>Reincorporate the previously sautéed lobster pieces, cover with the fish stock, adjust the salt, and let
                it cook for about 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes before serving and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
